# zendesk-code-challenge
A client + server node app for accessing Tickets from the Zendesk API and storing them in a backend mongoDB.

# Installation & Running
### Install Node.JS
This app has been tested on v4.4.6 of Node.js. You can find a binary for your OS here:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Install MongoDB
This app has been tested on v3.2.7 of the community server edition of MongoDB. You can find a binary for your OS here:
https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs#community

You can find additional installation information here:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

### Ensure MongoDB is running
In the 3.2.7 version of MongoDB, a data directory must be created. The default path depends on OS (see installation instructions) but a custom one can be supplied as a command line argument.

The full command is:
```
<path to binary>/mongod --dbpath <path to data directory> &
```

The '&' will run mongod as a background process. The path to the binary is optional if mongod has been added to your system's PATH variable. And the data directory argument is optional if you've created the default dat adirectory.

### Git CLONE
We assume a working knowledge of git! 

### Run NPM BUILD
In the app's root directory run the NPM BUILD command. This will run an NPM INSTALL to install all requisite node modules, followed by a series of unit tests.

### NPM START
Once the installation of node modules is complete and the tests have run, the NPM START command will run the 'server.js' file. As with 'mongod', consider appending & to run this in the background.

### Connect at localhost:8080
You should now be able to connect to the local server as a client on port 8080. React will serve you a list of the most recent tickets, and a pagination option. Your client will subscribe to the server's I/O stream, and will periodically recieve any new updates.
